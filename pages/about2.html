      <h2><u>Who Am I?</u></h2>
      <p><b>Hi, I'm Spencer,</b></p>
      <p>I'm passionate, dedicated, and love to get things done. As a Project Manager with a focus on digital marketing, I'm committed to quality, collaboration, and delivering real results for my clients. I'm currently based in San Francisco, CA, managing the deployment of email marketing campaigns for the Google Assistant.</p>
      <img class="body-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/gEOBOW0.jpg">
      <p align=center><b>How Did I Get Here?</b></p>
      <p>Before coming to San Francisco, I spent 3 years in Santa Cruz, CA, working with a wonderful nonprofit- <a href="https://scvolunteercenter.org/">The Volunteer Center of Santa Cruz County</a>. I came to the Volunteer Center through a position with Americorps- a national service program, often colloquially referred to as <i>"the domestic Peace Corps"</i>. As an Americorps member, I focused on building organizational capacity by recruiting and engaging community volunteers in meaningful projects around the county.</p>
      <p>After completing my term of service wth Americorps, I accepted a position to stay with the Volunteer Center, and expand my work into event coordination, fundraising, and development. I had the privilege to partner with local government officials, business leaders, and dozens of talented community members to tackle a variety of social, environmental, and economic issues. All in all, my events raised <b>over $1,000,000 for more than 150 local nonprofit organizations.</b></p>
      <img class="body-img" src="https://i.imgur.com/JiMATYz.jpg">
      <p>In addition to non-profit work, my educational background is focused in health and wellness. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Kinesiology from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and enjoy using my understanding of exercise and diet to lead a healthy life.<p>
      <p>Beyond these focus areas, I also have a strong interest in <b>web development and photography</b>. I believe in constant learning, and enjoy using my free time to expand my repertoire of expertise in these areas.</p>
      <p>Want to learn more about my events, projects, photos, or web work? Check out my portfolio <a href="./portfolio.html">here.</a></p>
      <p>In my free time, you’ll find me out surfing, playing my guitar, or doodling in my sketchbook. I love sitting outside on misty mornings with my coffee and a good book or relaxing around a campfire with friends. Always looking to learn new things, I enjoy the opportunity to explore new skills, ideas, and places. Eventually, I’d like to make my way to all 7 continents, and one day all the way up to the moon (one can dream right?). Moving forward, I am excited to continue to pursue my passions and give back wherever I can.</p>
      <p>So, do you want to make something happen? If so, I’d love to help. Please feel free to write me a message at spencer.takata@gmail.com</p>
