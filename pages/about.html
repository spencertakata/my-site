      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Spencer, and I'm in the business of making things happen. As a Project Manager, I specialize in guiding my team to achieve our goals and produce valuable results. Whether you’re coordinating community events, implementing programs, or building something entirely new, I bring the leadership and framework needed to transform an idea into a reality.</p>
      <p>Currently based in Santa Cruz, CA, my professional background is centered in the nonprofit sector. Working in this capacity, I have the opportunity meet people from all walks of life, listen to their stories, and help them attain their goals. For the last 3 years, I have worked to improve lives by leading community fundraising events, increasing organizational capacity, developing effective volunteer programs, and helping nonprofit professionals take their skills to the next level. Throughout my career, I’m proud to have raised over $1 million for more than 150 nonprofits, schools, and religious groups. I love the work I do because it allows me to make a powerful, measurable, and tangible difference in the lives of people around me.
      </p>
      <p>Although the majority of my career is focused in nonprofit work, I’m adaptable, balanced, and have a knack for catching on quickly to anything I put my mind to. I earned my B.S. in Kinesiology from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and apply what I’ve learned about exercise and healthy living in my everyday life. Outside of formal University education, I enjoy expanding my knowledge to continuously build upon my personal and professional skillset. Through independent study, I have developed a working proficiency with html and css, using what I’ve learned to build this site and assist with professional content management.
      </p>
      <p>To learn more about my professional projects and what I can do for you, I invite you to take a look at my portfolio. </p>
      <p>In my free time, you’ll find me out surfing, playing my guitar, or doodling in my sketchbook. I love sitting outside on misty mornings with my coffee and a good book or relaxing around a campfire with friends. Always looking to learn new things, I enjoy the opportunity to explore new skills, ideas, and places. Eventually, I’d like to make my way to all 7 continents, and- if good fortune allows it- all the way up to the moon (one can dream right?). Moving forward, I am excited to continue to pursue my passions and give back wherever I can.</p>
      <p>So, do you want to make something happen? If so, I’d love to help. Please feel free to write me a message at spencer.takata@gmail.com</p>
