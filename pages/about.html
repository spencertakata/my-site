      <h2><u>Who Am I?</u></h2>
      <p><b>Hi, I'm Spencer,</b></p>
      <p>I'm passionate, dedicated, and love to get things done. As a Project Manager with a focus on digital marketing, I'm committed to quality, collaboration, and delivering real results for my clients. I'm currently based in San Francisco, CA, managing the deployment of email marketing campaigns for the Google Assistant.</p>

      <p align=center><b>How Did I Get Here?</b></p>
      <p>Before coming to San Francisco, I spent 3 years in Santa Cruz, CA, working with a wonderful nonprofit- <a href="https://scvolunteercenter.org/">The Volunteer Center of Santa Cruz County</a>. I came to the Volunteer Center through a position with Americorps- a national service program, often colloquially referred to as <i>"the domestic Peace Corps"</i>. As an Americorps member, I focused on building organizational capacity by recruiting and engaging community volunteers in meaningful projects around the county.</p>
      <p>After completing my term of service wth Americorps, I accepted a position to stay with the Volunteer Center, and expand my work into event coordination, fundraising, and development. I had the privilege to partner with local government officials, business leaders, and dozens of talented community members to tackle a variety of social, environmental, and economic issues. All in all, my events raised <b>over $1,000,000 for more than 150 local nonprofit organizations.</b></p>

      <p align=center><b>"Learn By Doing"</b></p>
      <p>I graduated from Cal Poly  San Luis Obispo in 2014 with my B.S. in Kinesiology. As an undergrad, I served on the executive board of multiple student organizations including the Student Philanthropy Council and Interfraternity Council. Through my extracurricular involvement, I was able to act as a leader for student development, philanthropy, and volunteer efforts.</p>
      <p>Although my career took me a in different direction than my coursework, I enjoy using my understanding of exercise and diet to lead a healthy life, and applying the "Learn by Doing" motto to new challenges that come my way.<p>

      <p class="caption">Graduation Day- Considering how much time I spent at the beach, the board shorts just seemed right</p>
      <p>In my free time, you’ll find me out surfing, playing my guitar, or doodling in my sketchbook. I believe in constant improvement, and enjoy using my free time to create, learn, and grow. Most recently, I've started pursuing web development and photography. I like to consider myself a <i>"professional in training".</i></p>
      <p>Hmm, what else? I take my coffee black. I'll add avocado to anything. I prefer dogs, but cats are cool too. Eventually, I’d like to travel to all 7 continents, and one day all the way up to the moon (one can dream right?). Moving forward, I am excited to continue to pursue my passions and give back wherever I can.</p>
