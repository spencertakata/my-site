        <p>At the core of who I am lies an artist, someone who is passionate, dedicated, and loves to create. I champion radical self expression, and cherish the process of developing mastery over a skill. Whether through language, music, visual mediums, or craftmanship, I love the practice of turning a pile of building blocks into something beautiful. I'm a dreamer. I reach for the stars, and try to give my best to everything I do personally and&nbsp;professionally.</p>

I love taking my camera out, honing my skills as a photographer as I capture shots of the city, nature, and whatever else catches my&nbsp;eye.</p>

        <h4 class="headline"><b>How did I get here?</b></h4>
        <p>Currently I'm based in Northern California as a Web Developer with <a href="https://www.hawkeyeagency.com/">Hawkeye Agency</a>. Before becoming a Dev, I worked in Marketing, Project Management, and Nonprofit fundraising/event planning where I raised <b>over $1,000,000 for various nonprofit organizations.</b> I'm grateful that I can incorporate these diverse experiences into my current work by bridging the gap between Technical, Creative, and Business roles. My background has been a tremendous asset when it comes to communicating priorities across disiciplines, and facilitating balanced holistic solutions.</p>
        
        
        {# Before becoming a Dev, I spent a few years as a Project Manager working with clients to achieve their business goals. I'm grateful that I can integrate this client facing experience into my current work as a Developer by advising our PMs on technical matters, and bridging the gap between technical, creative, and business&nbsp;roles.</p>
        <p>Prior to Tech and Agency life, I spent 3 years in Santa Cruz, CA, working with a wonderful nonprofit- <a href="https://scvolunteercenter.org/">The Volunteer Center of Santa Cruz County</a>. I discovered the Volunteer Center through a position with <a href="https://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps">Americorps</a>, a national service program, often colloquially referred to as <i>"the domestic Peace Corps"</i>. As an Americorps member, I focused on building organizational capacity by recruiting and engaging community volunteers in meaningful projects around the county.</p>
        <p>After completing my term of service wth Americorps, I accepted a position to stay with the Volunteer Center, and expand my work into event coordination, fundraising, and development. I had the privilege to partner with local government officials, business leaders, and dozens of talented community members to tackle a variety of social, environmental, and economic issues.</p>
        <p>All in all, my events raised <b>over $1,000,000 for more than 150 local nonprofit organizations.</b></p> #}

        <h4 class="headline"><b>"Learn by Doing"</b></h4>
        <p>I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with my B.S. in Kinesiology. As an undergrad, I served on the executive board of multiple student organizations including the Student Philanthropy Council and Interfraternity Council. Through my extracurricular involvement, I was able to act as a leader for student development, philanthropy, and volunteer&nbsp;efforts.</p>
        <p>Although my career took me a in different direction than my coursework, I enjoy using my understanding of exercise and diet to lead a healthy life, and applying the "Learn by Doing" motto to new challenges that come my&nbsp;way.<p>
